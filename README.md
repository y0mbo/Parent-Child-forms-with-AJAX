Parent-Child Complex forms with jQuery AJAX updates
===================================================

This is a simple example of parent-child complex forms where children can be added via AJAX (using jQuery).

This code is based on Rails 3.1 and jQuery 1.8.1.

I used two sources as reference:

1. Moo-li's github repo: [Simple parent-child forms in Rails 3.1](https://github.com/moo-li/Simple-parent-child-forms-in-Rails-3.1)
1. Andrea Singh's great article: [AJAX in Rails 3 Roundup](http://www.madebydna.com/all/code/2011/12/05/ajax-in-rails-3.html)
